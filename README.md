# Web Girl Studio PHP edition

This folder is the classic-hosting version of the Web Girl Studio landing page.
It uses PHP 8+, semantic HTML, standalone CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Studio operating system

Studio strategy, creative direction, delivery standards, reusable workflows and
repo-scoped skills live in the non-public operating-system layer. Start with
`AGENTS.md`, then follow `docs/wgs/00-start-here/WGS-SOURCE-MANIFEST.md`.
These files do not change the public website or its production runtime.

Validate the operating-system structure and skill frontmatter with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate-wgs-os.ps1
```

## Deploy

1. Upload the contents of this folder to the public directory of a PHP 8+ host.
2. Contact-form enquiries are delivered to `hello@webgirl.studio`.
3. Make `storage/` writable by PHP. It is a fallback only when the host's
   `mail()` transport is unavailable.
4. Keep `storage/.htaccess` in place on Apache. For Nginx, deny web access to
   the `/storage` path in the server configuration.
5. Submit a test enquiry after deployment and verify email delivery.

The form includes server-side validation, a CSRF token, a honeypot, basic
session rate limiting, mail delivery and a locked JSONL fallback.

## Portfolio routes

- `/work/` - proof-led index split into Client Work and completed Independent Studies
- `/culture/` - Creative Industries niche landing page (route retained for compatibility)
- `/projects/fortepiano-academy/` - live founder-built client case study
- `/projects/mira-silt/`
- `/projects/ninth-form/`
- `/projects/second-weather/`
- `/projects/sasha-mirev/`
- `/projects/quiet-signal/`
- `/projects/mira-silt/site/` - complete interactive fictional artist website
- `/projects/ninth-form/site/` - complete interactive fictional fashion store

Portfolio copy, metadata, placeholder testimonials and the non-public Face Not
Fake case-study pipeline live in `content/projects.php`. Only Fortepiano Academy,
Mira Silt and Ninth Form are listed publicly. Other concept routes remain intact
for compatibility but are deliberately absent from Work until final media exists.

Mira Silt and Ninth Form campaign/editorial assets are integrated under their
respective `img/portfolio/` directories. Both now have classic-PHP interactive
concept websites. Their controls remain honest demonstrations: no music service,
ticketing, payment, mailing-list or wholesale submission is connected.

Run the local smoke test after starting the PHP development server on port 8099:

```powershell
$env:WGS_NODE_MODULES = 'path-to-bundled-node_modules'
node scripts/portfolio-smoke.cjs
```

## Analytics

The production pages use one direct GA4 Google tag from `components/analytics.php`.
Analytics is automatically disabled on non-production hostnames. Custom events are
implemented in `assets/analytics-events.js` and contain no enquiry form values.

Run the analytics regression test against the same local PHP server with
`WGS_TEST_MODE=1` set on the server process:

```powershell
$env:WGS_NODE_MODULES = 'path-to-bundled-node_modules'
node scripts/analytics-smoke.cjs
```
